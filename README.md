# Operations-Using-Data-Types-and-Operators-Python
   Python has several data types and operators, namely Data Type Conversion, Input and Output, List, set and string operations, Operator, Operand, and Expressions, Dynamic Typing, Transform Number, Characters, and String, Conditional Expression, Replacing String Elements, String Checking and Formatting String.

Below is a summary and sections of each material:
    
1. Data Type Conversion
   - Converting Integers to Floats
   - Converting Floats to Integers
   - Converting Numbers to Strings
   - Converting List to Tuples
   - Converting to List
   - Converting to Set
   - Converting to Dictionary
   
2. Input and Output
   - Variable
   - Print
   - Directly concatenate variables in the print() statement
   - Formatting
   - Using "%" operator added with "Argument specifiers"
   - Function Input()

3. List, set and string operations
   - List Operations
   - Set Operations
   - String Operations
   
4. Operator, Operand, and Expressions
   - Arithmetic Operator 
   - Comparison Operator 
   - Assignment Operator 
   - Logical Operator
   - Bitwise Operator 
   - Membership Operator 
   - Identity Operator
   
5. Dynamic Typing
     which is a programming language that only knows the type of variables when the program is running and assignments are made.

6. Transform Number, Characters, and String
   - Case Manipulators:
     - .upper()
     - .lower()
   - String Methods:
     - .rstrip()
     - .lstrip()
     - .strip()
   - Testing for Substring-hood:
     - .starswith()
     - .endswith()
     
7. Conditional Expression
   - IF function
   - IF ELSE function
   - ELIF function

8. Replacing String Elements
    is an inbuilt function in the Python programming language that returns a copy of the string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring.

9. String Checking
   - Isupper()
   - Islower()
   - Isalpha()
   - Isalnum()
   - Isdecimal()

10. Formatting String
    - string.rjust(i)
    - string.ljust(i)
    - string.center(i)
    - String Literals
    - Raw Strings
